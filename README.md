Ethereum DAPP for STAR NOTARY 

This project uses Ethereum ecosystem to create decentralized application DAPP for managing Star Notary system. It has front end in HTML/Java script and it uses tools like Solidity, Infura, Ganache, Mocha, Chai, Truffle etc. to develop backend based on Ethereum blockchain. The application allows to register a STAR using ERC721 non-fungible token (NFT) and also allows to look up if a particular star with ID has been registered. 
The environment set up for the project and versions are as follows:

$ truffle -v
Truffle v5.7.3 (core: 5.7.3)
Ganache v7.7.3
Solidity - 0.5.1 (solc-js)
Node v18.12.1
Web3.js v1.8.1
Openzeppelin-solidity version is 2.3

•	ERC-721 Token Name = “DecentralizedYellowSun”
•	ERC-721 Token Symbol = SYD
•	“Token Address” on the Goerli Network:
https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xFB1e9CF1D94fb443a07aA84DB5FAd869784dCa55
•	Contract: 0xFB1e9CF1D94fb443a07aA84DB5FAd869784dCa55

Task 3: Contract was deployed on Goerli network.
•	“Token Address” on the Goerli Network:
https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xFB1e9CF1D94fb443a07aA84DB5FAd869784dCa55
•	Contract address: 0xFB1e9CF1D94fb443a07aA84DB5FAd869784dCa55

Task 4: The Star is then successfully able to be looked up at localhost
Condition when Star is found:
